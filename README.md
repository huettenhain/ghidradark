# Jesko's Ghidra Config

This is how I like to configure Ghidra.

- Get my [IDA-Like Key Bindings](ghIDA.kbxml): In the **Code Browser** window, go to **Edit** → **Tool Options** → **Key Bindings** → **Import**.
- Get my [Higher Contrast Dark Theme](main.theme): In the main project window, go to **Edit** → **Theme** → **Import**.

For the proper retro look, you need to install the two fonts [FixedSysEx](FixedSysEx.ttf) and [FixedSysEx-Bold](FixedSysEx-Bold.ttf), which are identical, except that the "bold" variant advertises itself as being bold. It looks like this:
